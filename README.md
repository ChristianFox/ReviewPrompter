# ReviewPrompter

ReviewPrompter is an open-source library for iOS applications written in Swift that helps you intelligently prompt users for app reviews. It tracks the occurrence of specific events within your app and requests a review prompt when the specified conditions are met. ReviewPrompter ensures that users are not prompted too frequently by implementing a minimum time interval between each prompt.

## Dependencies

`ReviewPrompter` is a subclass of `EventTracker` and so depends on the [EventTracker](http://github.com/ChristianFox/EventTracker) library.

## Features

- Tracks occurrences of named events in your app
- Requests review prompts when the number of events matches the specified condition
- Ensures a minimum time interval between each prompt
- Allows for manual triggering of review prompts
- Supports event count resetting
- Provides an option to enable or disable logging

## üß™ Tests

The library is basically fully tested with 98.5% code coverage

## üíª Installation

### Swift Package Manager
To add ReviewPrompter to your project using Swift Package Manager, add the following dependency in your Package.swift file:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/ChristianFox/ReviewPrompter.git", from: "1.0.0")
]
```

Don't forget to add ReviewPrompter to your target dependencies:

```swift
targets: [
    .target(
        name: "YourTarget",
        dependencies: ["ReviewPrompter"]),
]
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

### ReviewPrompter

Initialise an instance

```swift
let reviewPrompter = ReviewPrompter(minimumPromptInterval: 60 * 60 * 24 * 7) // 1 week
```

Increase the event count and request a review prompt if the condition is met. Callback is used to inform the caller if a review prompt has been requested.

```swift
do {
    try reviewPrompter.increaseEventCountWithReviewPrompt(forIdentifier: "event1") { didRequestReview in
        print("Review prompt requested: \(didRequestReview)")
    }
} catch {
    print("Error: \(error)")
}
```

Manually triggr a review prompt

```swift
let didRequest = reviewPrompter.requestReviewPrompt()
print("Review prompt requested: \(didRequest)")
```

If needed, you can delete the history of review prompt dates with the deleteHistoryOfReviewPromptDates() method:

```swift
reviewPrompter.deleteHistoryOfReviewPromptDates()
```


### Inherited from EventTracker

Begin tracking an event

```swift
reviewPrompter.trackEvent(forIdentifier: "event1", withCondition: 3)
```

Stop tracking an event

```swift
reviewPrompter.stopTrackingEvent(forIdentifier: "event1")
```

Change the condition for an event

```swift
do {
    try reviewPrompter.changeCondition(5, forIdentifier: "event1")
} catch {
    print("Error updating event condition: \(error)")
}
```

Increase the event count
 
```swift
do {
    try reviewPrompter.increaseEventCount(forIdentifier: "event1")
} catch {
    print("Error increasing event count: \(error)")
}
```


Reset the event count

```swift
do {
    try reviewPrompter.resetEventCount(forIdentifier: "event1")
} catch {
    print("Error resetting event count: \(error)")
}
```

Check if an event's condition has been met

```swift
if reviewPrompter.hasEventMetCondition(forIdentifier: "event1") {
    print("Event met condition!")
}
```

Check an event is being tracked

```swift
if reviewPrompter.isTrackingEvent(forIdentifier: "event1") {
    print("Event is being tracked!")
}
```

Check the number of times an event has occured

```swift
let eventCount = reviewPrompter.eventCount(forIdentifier: "event1")
print("Event count: \(eventCount)")
```

Check the current condition of an event

```swift
let eventCondition = reviewPrompter.condition(forIdentifier: "event1")
print("Event condition: \(eventCondition)")
```
